# ClassificationML

Successfully managed to divide my dataset into 4:1, training:test dataset. Trained my ML model to check if my test data would buy from social network ads based on their annual income and the training dataset's history of buying using the Kernel-SVM classification.
I got a very pleasant result of only 7 wrong outcomes out 100 data in my test set.
